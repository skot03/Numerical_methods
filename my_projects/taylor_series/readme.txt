In this project, I had to implement an algorithm to calculate the values of the function [1 - exp(-x)]/x within the given interval: [10^-30, 10^9]. 
After calculating the function values, I had to determine the changes in relative error.
I made a graph using GNUPLOT to plot the logarithm (base 10) of the absolute value of the relative error (y-axis) against the logarithm (base 10) of x (x-axis) in one graph.
I have published this graph here and my c++ program
